# ðŸ“Š Bank Customer Segmentation â€“ Power BI Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Power BI** to analyze and visualize **bank customer data** for segmentation, transaction behavior, and risk profiling. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights that support customer understanding, retention strategies, and profitability analysis.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

* **Customer Demographics Analysis**

  * Age, gender, and location distribution
  * Segmentation across different demographic groups

* **Transaction Behavior Insights**

  * Total transaction volume and average transaction amount
  * Peak transaction times (daily/weekly patterns)
  * Account balance analysis across customers

* **Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)**

  * Identification of loyal, new, and lost customers
  * Revenue contribution by different customer segments
  * Transaction frequency across age and gender groups

* **Profitability & Risk Indicators**

  * Revenue vs. risk analysis using credit scores
  * High-risk vs. high-value customer profiling
  * Top 10 high-revenue but high-risk customers

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following fields:

* `TransactionID` â€“ Unique transaction identifier
* `CustomerID` â€“ Unique customer identifier
* `CustomerDOB` â€“ Customer date of birth (for age analysis)
* `CustGender` â€“ Gender of customer
* `CustLocation` â€“ Geographic location
* `CustAccountBalance` â€“ Account balance at transaction time
* `TransactionDate` â€“ Date of transaction
* `TransactionTime` â€“ Time of transaction
* `TransactionAmount (INR)` â€“ Transaction value

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI** â€“ Dashboard design & visualization
* **DAX** â€“ Measures and calculated fields
* **Data Cleaning & Transformation** â€“ Power Query

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard includes:

* KPI Cards (Total Customers, Revenue, Transactions, Risk Indicators)
* Bar/Column Charts (Customer distribution, revenue contribution)
* Pie/Donut Charts (Gender, age group, customer segments)
* Scatter & Boxplots (Transaction patterns, balance vs. risk)
* Slicers & Filters (By segment, age, gender, location, date range)

## ðŸš€ Outcome

This project showcases how **business intelligence tools like Power BI** can transform raw banking data into powerful insights for:

* Understanding customer behavior
* Identifying loyal and high-value customers
* Managing risk through data-driven segmentation
* Supporting strategic decision-making

## ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements

* Predictive modeling for churn risk
* Integration with real-time transaction data
* Advanced RFM segmentation with clustering techniques
